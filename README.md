# Symbiotic Sonnet üé®

A generative art experience where AI and human creativity converge.

> This project was created for the **Cerebras X Cline Hackathon**.

## ‚ú® Project Description

**Symbiotic Sonnet** is an exploration of the creative partnership between human and machine ü§ù, designed as a piece of functional art.

Built with **Next.js** and **React Three Fiber** üíª, the application leverages the **Cerebras AI API** üß† to generate a unique, multi-sensory experience from a single user-provided theme. As the AI composes a four-line poem in real-time üìú, a corresponding abstract 3D constellation of shapes animates into view, with colors, forms, and a dynamic background that reflect the mood of the text.

Each interaction creates a new, ephemeral piece of art, transforming a simple word into a living, visual, and poetic performance that exists only for a moment ‚è≥.
